     <p class="product-description">Guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally made from wood and used with animal gut, nylon or steel string and distinguished from other chordophones by making and tuning. Modern guitars are inherited from gittern, vihuela, four-Renaissance, and five baroque guitars, all of which contributed to the development of this modern six-string instrument. Is there something special behind the name Northerly Gale? Of course it's not just the name of a guitar company, it's actually a promise, an emotional promise to every customer.

NG, short for Northerly Gale, was born in the 1960s, the golden age of craft guitar making. The goal of this company is to bring the most genuine emotions, helping artists bring melodies from their own hearts to the audience. Because we all know that music that comes from an emotional heart is always very strong, but not every guitar can help an artist uplift. That makes Northerly Gale's name, and it's exactly the secret behind the Northerly Gale - the Guitar of Emotions.</p>
